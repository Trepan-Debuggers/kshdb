Entering the Ksh Debugger

Invoking the Debugger Initially
====================================

The simplest way to debug your program is to call run `kshdb`. Give
the name of your program and its options and any debugger options:

.. code:: console

        $ cat /etc/profile

        if [ "${PS1-}" ]; then
            if [ "`id -u`" -eq 0 ]; then
              PS1='# '
            else
              PS1='$ '
            fi
          fi
        fi

        if [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then
          for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do
            if [ -r $i ]; then
              . $i
            fi
          done
          unset i
        fi

        $ kshdb /etc/profile

For help on `kshdb` or options, use the ``--help`` option.

.. code:: console

        $ kshdb --help

	Usage:
           kshdb [OPTIONS] <script_file>

        Runs ksh <script_file> under a debugger.

        options:
        ...



Calling the debugger from your program
===========================================

Sometimes it is not feasible to invoke the program from the debugger.
Although the debugger tries to set things up to make it look like your
program is called, sometimes the differences matter. Also the debugger
adds overhead and slows down your program.

Another possibility then is to add statements into your program to call
the debugger at the spot in the program you want. To do this, you source
`kshdb/dbg-trace.sh` from where wherever it appears on your filesystem.
This needs to be done only once.

After that you call `_Dbg_debugger`.

Here is an Example:

.. code:: console

    source path-to-kshdb/kshdb/dbg-trace.sh
    # work, work, work.
    # ... some ksh code

    _Dbg_debugger
    # start debugging here


Since `_Dbg_debugger` a function call, it can be nested inside some sort of
conditional statement allowing one to be very precise about the
conditions you want to debug under. And until first call to `_Dbg_debugger`,
there is no debugger overhead.

Note that `_Dbg_debugger` causes the statement *after* the call to be stopped at.
