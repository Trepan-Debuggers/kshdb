List (show me the code!)
------------------------

**list**[**>**] [ *location*|**.**|**-** [ *num* ]]

**list** *location* [*num*]

List source code.

Without arguments, print lines centered around the current line. If
*num* is given that number of lines is shown.

If this is the first `list` command issued since the debugger command
loop was entered, then the current line is the current frame. If a
subsequent list command was issued with no intervening frame changing,
then that is start the line after we last one previously shown.

A *location* is either:

* a number, e.g. 5,
* a filename, colon, and a number, e.g. `/etc/profile:5`,
* a "." for the current line number
* a "-" for the lines before the current linenumber

If the location form is used with a subsequent parameter, the
parameter is the starting line number is used. When there two numbers
are given, the last number value is treated as a stopping line unless
it is less than the start line, in which case it is taken to mean the
number of lines to list instead.

Wherever a number is expected, it does not need to be a constant --
just something that evaluates to a positive integer.

::

    list 5                  # List starting from line 5
    list 4+1                # Same as above.
    list /etc/profile:5     # List starting from line 5 of /etc/profile
    list /etc/profile 5     # Same as above.
    list /etc/profile 5 6   # list lines 5 and 6 of /etc/profile
    list /etc/profile 5 2   # Same as above, since 2 < 5.
    list profile:5 2        # List two lines starting from line 5 of profile
    list .                  # List lines centered from where we currently are stopped
    list -                  # List lines previous to those just shown
