kshdb - a gdb-like debugger for zsh
========================================

kshdb is a gdb-like debugger for zsh_.

Since this debugger is similar to other_ trepanning_ debuggers_ and *gdb*
in general, knowledge gained by learning this is transferable to those
debuggers and vice versa.

An Emacs interface is available via realgud_. Visual Studio integration is available from rogalmic via
ZshDebug_.
