kshdb command
#############

Synopsis
--------


**kshdb** [ *debugger-options* ] [ \-- ] [ *zsh-script* [ *script-options* ...]]

**kshdb** [ *options*] -c *execution-string*

Description
-----------

*kshdb* is a *zsh* script to which arranges for another *zsh* script
to be debugged.

The debugger has a similar command interface as gdb_.

If your zsh script needs to be passed options, add ``--`` before the
script name. That will tell *kshdb* not to try to process any further
options.

Options
--------

:-h | --help:

Print a usage message on standard error and exit with a return code
of 100.

:-A | --annotation *level*:

Sets to output additional stack and status information which allows
front-ends such as Emacs to track what's going on without polling.

This is needed in for regression testing. Using this
option is equivalent to issuing:

::

    set annotate LEVEL

inside the debugger. See :ref:`set annotate <set_annotate>` for more information on that command

:-B | --basename:

In places where a filename appears in debugger output give just the
basename only. This is needed in for regression testing. Using this
option is equivalent to issuing:

::

   set basename on

inside the debugger. See :ref:`set basename <set_basename>` for more information on that command


:-n | --nx | --no-init:

Normally the debugger will read debugger commands in `~/.kshdbinit` if
that file exists before accepting user interaction.  `.kshdbinit` is
analogous to GNU gdb's `.gdbinit`: a user might want to create such a
debugger profile to add various user-specific customizations.

Using the `-n` option this initialization file will not be read. This
is useful in regression testing or in tracking down a problem with
one's `.kshdbinit` profile.


:-c | --command *command-string*:

Instead of specifying the name of a script file, one can give an
execution string that is to be debugged. Use this option to do that.


:-q | --quiet:

Do not print introductory version and copyright information. This is
again useful in regression testing where we don't want to include a
changeable copyright date in the regression-test matching.


:-x | --eval-command *debugger-cmdfile*:

Run the debugger commands *debugger-cmdfile* before accepting user
input.  These commands are read however after any `.kshdbinit`
commands. Again this is useful running regression-testing debug
scripts.


:-L | --library *debugger-library*:

The debugger needs to source or include a number of functions and
these reside in a library. If this option is not given the default
location of library is relative to the installed kshdb script:
`../lib/kshdb`.



:-T | --tempdir *temporary-file-directory*:

The debugger needs to make use of some temporary filesystem storage to
save persistent information across a subshell return or in order to
evaluate an expression. The default directory is `/tmp` but you can
use this option to set the directory where debugger temporary files
will be created.


:-t | --tty *tty-name*:

Debugger output usually goes to a terminal rather than stdout or stdin
which the debugged program may use. Determination of the tty or
pseudo-tty is normally done automatically. However if you want to
control where the debugger output goes, use this option.


:-V | --version:

Show version number and no-warranty and exit with return code 1.

Bugs
----

The way this script arranges debugging to occur is by including (or
actually "source"-ing) some debug-support code and then sourcing the
given script or command string.

One problem with sourcing a debugged script is that the program name
stored in ``$0`` will not be the name of the script to be debugged. The
debugged script will appear in a call stack not as the top item but as
the item below `kshdb`.

The `kshdb` script option assumes a version of zsh with debugging
support, zsh 4.3.6-dev-2 or later.

The debugger slows things down a little because the debugger has to
intercept every statement and check to see if some action is to be taken.
