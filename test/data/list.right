list [LOC|.|-] [COUNT] -- List COUNT lines of a script starting from LOC

START is the starting location or dot (.) for current file and
line. Subsequent list commands continue from the last line
listed. Frame switching however resets the line to dot.

If COUNT is omitted, use the setting LISTSIZE. Use "set listsize" to 
change this setting.
