**list**[**>**] [*location*|**.**|**-**] [*num*]

list source code.

without arguments, print lines centered around the current line. if
*location* is given, that number of lines is shown.

if this is the first list command issued since the debugger command
loop was entered, then the current line is the current frame. if a
subsequent list command was issued with no intervening frame changing,
then that is start the line after we last one previously shown.

a *location* is either:

* a number, e.g. 5,
* a filename, colon, and a number, e.g. `/etc/profile:5`,
* a "." for the current line number
* a "-" for the lines before the current linenumber

by default aliases **l>** and **list>** are set to list. in this case and
more generally when the alias ends in ">", rather than center lines
around *location* that will be used as the starting point.

examples:
---------

    list 5                  # list starting from line 5
    list 4+1                # same as above.
    list /etc/profile:5     # list starting from line 5 of /etc/profile
    list /etc/profile 5     # same as above.
    list /etc/profile 5 6   # list lines 5 and 6 of /etc/profile
    list /etc/profile 5 2   # same as above, since 2 < 5.
    list profile:5 2        # list two lines starting from line 5 of profile
    list .                  # list lines centered from where we currently are stopped
    list -                  # list lines previous to those just shown
