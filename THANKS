Thanks to David Korn for the adding necessary support to ksh
needed to get this off the ground and make debugging possible.

Thanks to Kate Ward, St√©phane Chazelas and Nikolaj Schumacher for
programs used in conjunction with kshdb.

The Siteshwar Vashisht and Kurtis Rader of the github AST team made fixes to
ksh that made it again possible for this to work on again, after 4
years or so of brokenness.
