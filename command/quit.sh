_Dbg_help_add quit \
'**quit** [*exit-code* [*shell-levels*]]

Quit the debugger.

The program being debugged is aborted.  If *exit-code* is given, then
that will be the exit return code. If *shell-levels* is given, then up
to that many nested shells are quit. However to be effective, the last
of those shells should have been run under the debugger.
