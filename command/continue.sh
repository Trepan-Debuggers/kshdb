_Dbg_help_add continue \
'**continue** [*loc* | **-** ]

Continue script execution.

If *loc* or *-* is not given, continue until the next breakpoint or
the end of program is reached.  If **-** is given, then debugging will
be turned off after continuing causing your program to run at full
speed.

If **loc* is given, a temporary breakpoint is set at the location.

Examples:
---------

    continue          # Continue execution
    continue 5        # Continue with a one-time breakpoint at line 5

See Also:
---------

**next**, **skip**, and **step** provide other ways to progress execution.'
